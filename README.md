# MIPS32-processor
This project implements a behavioral MIPS32 processor with a 5-stage pipeline (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB). Designed and simulated using Verilog HDL,  computer architecture concepts such as pipelining, data forwarding, and hazard handling.  Includes  source code and testbenches for functional verification in tools like ModelSim, Vivado, or Icarus Verilog.
